# MyGym Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for MyGym, a web-based application for video upload, pose detection, and exercise repetition counting. The application will allow users to upload workout videos, analyze them for proper form, and count repetitions of exercises like squats, with extensibility for other movements.

## Key Goals
1. Create a web application that allows users to upload and view workout videos
2. Implement local storage of videos using IndexedDB
3. Integrate pose detection using MediaPipe Pose
4. Display pose keypoints as an overlay on videos
5. Implement repetition counting for squats
6. Design for extensibility to other exercises
7. Ensure client-side processing for privacy and efficiency

## Technical Constraints
1. Storage limitations of IndexedDB (varies by browser, typically 50% of free disk space)
2. Performance considerations for processing large video files
3. Accuracy limitations of pose detection algorithms
4. Synchronization requirements between video playback and keypoint overlay
5. Browser compatibility for video formats and APIs

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic UI (Week 1)
- Set up project structure with TypeScript, HTML, and CSS
- Create basic UI layout with navigation and placeholders for main features
- Implement responsive design for different device sizes
- Set up build and development environment

### Phase 2: Video Upload and Storage (Week 2)
- Implement video file selection using HTML `<input type="file">` with `accept="video/*"`
- Set up IndexedDB database schema using dexie.js
- Create functions to store video blobs in IndexedDB
- Implement video listing and retrieval from storage
- Add storage management features (view usage, delete videos)

### Phase 3: Video Playback (Week 3)
- Implement video player using HTML5 `<video>` element
- Create video controls (play, pause, seek, etc.)
- Handle different video formats and error states
- Implement video metadata extraction and display
- Add video thumbnail generation for the library view

### Phase 4: Pose Detection Integration (Week 4-5)
- Integrate MediaPipe Pose library
- Implement frame extraction from videos for processing
- Create processing queue for handling video frames
- Implement on-demand processing with progress indicators
- Store pose keypoint data with timestamps for later retrieval

### Phase 5: Keypoint Visualization (Week 6)
- Create canvas overlay system synchronized with video playback
- Implement keypoint and skeleton drawing functions
- Add options for customizing visualization (colors, size, etc.)
- Ensure proper synchronization between video and overlay
- Optimize rendering performance

### Phase 6: Squat Repetition Counting (Week 7)
- Define rules for detecting squat movements based on keypoints
- Implement state machine for tracking exercise states
- Create algorithm for counting repetitions based on state transitions
- Add visualization of counted repetitions
- Implement calibration for different users and video angles


## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- HTML5 and CSS3 for structure and styling
- Canvas API for keypoint visualization
- IndexedDB for local storage via dexie.js

### Libraries
- MediaPipe Pose for pose detection
- dexie.js for IndexedDB interaction
- Potentially Web Workers for parallel processing

### Data Flow
1. User uploads video → stored in IndexedDB
2. User selects video for viewing → retrieved from IndexedDB
3. User requests pose analysis → frames processed by MediaPipe
4. Keypoints stored with timestamps → retrieved during playback
5. Keypoints analyzed for exercise detection → repetitions counted

## Milestones and Deliverables

### Milestone 1: MVP with Basic Functionality (End of Week 5)
- Video upload and storage
- Basic video playback
- Initial pose detection implementation

### Milestone 2: Core Features Complete (End of Week 8)
- Full video management
- Pose detection and visualization
- Squat repetition counting
- Basic extensibility framework

### Milestone 3: Production-Ready Application (End of Week 10)
- Complete feature set
- Optimized performance
- Comprehensive documentation
- Polished UI/UX

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Performance issues with large videos**
   - Mitigation: Implement batch processing, progress indicators, and optional downsampling

2. **Browser storage limitations**
   - Mitigation: Clear storage management UI, warnings when approaching limits

3. **Pose detection accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Provide calibration options, visual feedback on detection quality

4. **Browser compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Feature detection, graceful degradation, clear browser requirements

### Project Risks
1. **Scope creep**
   - Mitigation: Clear prioritization of features, regular reviews against requirements

2. **Timeline slippage**
   - Mitigation: Buffer time built into schedule, modular approach allowing partial deliveries

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the MyGym application, with clear phases, milestones, and risk management strategies. The modular design allows for incremental development and testing, with opportunities to gather feedback and make adjustments throughout the process.
