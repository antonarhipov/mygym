# Key Points

It seems likely that you can build a web-based application using JavaScript, HTML5, and libraries like MediaPipe Pose
for pose detection.

Research suggests storing videos in IndexedDB for local storage, though performance may vary with large files.

The evidence leans toward using canvas overlays for displaying pose keypoints, processed on demand for efficiency.

Counting squat repetitions is possible by analyzing keypoint movements, with potential for extending to other exercises.

## Video Upload and Viewing

To upload and view video files, use an HTML `<input type="file">` to select videos, then store them in IndexedDB using a
library like `dexie.js` for local storage. Display videos using the HTML5 `<video>` element with `URL.createObjectURL()`
to create a playable source from the stored blob.

---

## Pose Detection and Overlay

For pose detection, integrate **MediaPipe Pose (MediaPipe Pose for Web)**, which processes video frames to detect
keypoints. Create a canvas overlay to draw these keypoints, synchronized with video playback, and process on demand to
manage performance.

---

## Repetition Counting and Extensibility

Analyze keypoint sequences to count squat repetitions by defining rules (e.g., hip below knee indicates a squat). Extend
functionality by creating modular exercise analyzers, allowing for future additions like push-ups or lunges.

## Comprehensive Analysis and Implementation Details

This section provides a detailed exploration of building a web-based application for video upload, pose detection, and
exercise repetition counting, based on current web technologies and research as of April 14, 2025. The focus is on
leveraging client-side processing for privacy and efficiency, with considerations for scalability and performance.

### Application Overview and Requirements

The application aims to allow users to upload video files, store them locally, view them, analyze for human poses,
overlay detected keypoints, and count repetitions of exercises like squats, with extensibility for other movements.
Given the "local storage" specification, the design prioritizes client-side processing to avoid server dependencies,
enhancing user privacy and reducing costs.

### Technology Stack and Implementation

#### **Video Upload and Local Storage**

- The initial challenge is handling video uploads and storage. Traditional browser storage like `LocalStorage` is
  limited to 5–10MB, unsuitable for videos, which can be hundreds of megabytes. IndexedDB, however, supports large
  binary data, making it a viable option for local storage. The implementation involves:
    - Using `<input type="file">` with `accept="video/*"` to restrict to video formats.
    - Storing the selected video file as a Blob in IndexedDB, potentially using `dexie.js` for a simpler API. For
      example, a database schema might include a "videos" store with keys like video ID, name, and blob data.
    - Retrieving and displaying videos by fetching the Blob, creating a URL with `URL.createObjectURL()`, and setting it
      as the source for a `<video>` element.
- Research suggests IndexedDB can handle large files, but performance may degrade with many or very large videos due to
  browser storage limits, which vary by device and browser (typically 50% of free disk space, capped at several
  gigabytes). Users should be informed of storage usage and given options to delete old videos.

---

### **Video Viewing and Playback**

- Viewing stored videos is straightforward using the HTML5 `<video>` element. The application can list stored videos
  from IndexedDB, allowing users to select one for playback.
- Considerations include ensuring compatibility with common video formats (e.g., MP4, WebM) and handling errors for
  unsupported formats.

---

### **Pose Detection and Keypoint Overlay**

- Pose detection requires processing video frames to identify human keypoints (e.g., joints like hips, knees). Given the
  web context:
    - MediaPipe Pose (MediaPipe Pose for Web) and TensorFlow.js with MoveNet are suitable, with MediaPipe chosen for its
      performance and ease of integration.
- The workflow involves:
    - Loading the video into a `<video>` element.
    - Using MediaPipe Pose to process frames, either in real-time during playback or on-demand. Given the "on demand"
      specification, processing can occur when the user requests analysis, storing results for later viewing.
    - Drawing keypoints on a `<canvas>` overlay, positioned absolutely over the video, synchronized with playback using
      the video’s `currentTime` property.
- Processing every frame may be computationally intensive, especially for long videos or high resolutions. A practical
  approach is to process at a reduced frame rate (e.g., 10–15 fps) for efficiency, balancing accuracy and performance.
  Web Workers could offload computation, but initial implementation can use sequential processing with performance
  monitoring.

### **Repetition Counting for Squats**

- Counting squat repetitions requires analyzing the sequence of keypoints over time. For squats, define rules based on
  keypoint positions:
    - Identify standing position (e.g., hip above knee by a threshold).
    - Detect squatting when the hip goes below the knee by a certain depth, ensuring movement duration avoids counting
      noise.
    - Use a state machine: track transitions from standing to squatting and back, incrementing the count per cycle.
    - For example, if the hip `y`-coordinate is below the knee `y`-coordinate by 10% of body height for at least 0.5
      seconds, count as a squat. This approach handles noise and ensures accuracy, though calibration may be needed for
      different users or video qualities.

---

### Extensibility for Other Exercises

- To extend to other exercises (e.g., push-ups, lunges), create a modular system where each exercise has its own
  analyzer. Define rules based on keypoint movements, such as:
    - **Push-ups**: Track elbow angle and body position relative to the ground.
    - **Lunges**: Monitor leg extension and hip movement.
- This modularity allows adding new exercises without redesigning the core system, enhancing maintainability. Each
  analyzer could be a JavaScript class or module, processing keypoint data with exercise-specific logic.

### Performance and Scalability Considerations

1. **Video Processing Time**: Long videos may take significant time to process, especially at high frame rates. Consider
   batch processing or progress indicators for user feedback.
2. **Storage Limits**: IndexedDB storage varies by browser; inform users of limits and provide management options.
3. **Accuracy of Pose Detection**: MediaPipe Pose may struggle with occluded body parts or multiple people, potentially
   requiring user guidance or model selection for accuracy.
4. **Synchronization**: Ensure the keypoint overlay aligns with video playback, using timestamps or frame numbers for
   precise matching.

---

### Example Workflow

1. User uploads a video via `<input type="file">`, stored in IndexedDB.
2. User selects the video for viewing, played via `<video>` element.
3. On demand, user requests pose analysis; the application processes frames, storing keypoints with timestamps.
4. During playback, the canvas overlays keypoints, and the system counts squats based on keypoint rules.
5. Users can extend functionality by adding new exercise analyzers, each with custom logic.

### Comparative Analysis of Pose Estimation Libraries

| Library                   | Pros                                       | Cons                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **MediaPipe Pose**        | High accuracy, good performance, web-ready | May require WASM for optimal speed    |

### Conclusion

Building this application is feasible using modern web technologies, with **MediaPipe Pose** for pose detection, *
*IndexedDB** for local storage, and **canvas** for overlays. Repetition counting for squats is achievable through
keypoint analysis, with extensibility for other exercises via modular design. Users should be aware of potential
performance impacts with large videos, and future enhancements could include Web Workers for parallel processing.
