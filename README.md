# MyGym - AI-Powered Workout Analysis

## Overview

MyGym is a web-based application for video upload, pose detection, and exercise repetition counting. The application allows users to upload workout videos, analyze them for proper form, and count repetitions of exercises like squats, with extensibility for other movements.

## Features

- **Video Upload and Storage**: Upload workout videos and store them locally in your browser
- **Video Playback**: Watch your workout videos with custom playback controls
- **Pose Detection**: Analyze videos to detect body poses using MediaPipe Pose
- **Keypoint Visualization**: View detected body keypoints overlaid on your videos
- **Exercise Repetition Counting**: Automatically count squat repetitions (with more exercises coming soon)
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens locally in your browser - no videos are uploaded to any server

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Canvas API
- **Libraries**:
  - MediaPipe Pose for pose detection
  - Dexie.js for IndexedDB interaction
- **Build Tools**: Vite, TypeScript

## Current Status

The project is currently in active development:

- âœ… Project setup and basic UI
- âœ… Video upload and storage
- âœ… Video playback
- âœ… Pose detection integration
- âœ… Keypoint visualization
- ðŸ”„ Squat repetition counting (in progress)
